# consciousness-demo
- This was the creative project for the Honors course Human Consciousness.
- I made a two-part project in Unity using C#.
- The first part is a demo of how the conscious mind simulates potential futures and keeps the "successful" ones.
- The second part was a simple, 2-player game based on the same concept for an interactive element to the presentation.
## How to Run
- This repo can be cloned or downloaded and run from Unity.
- The code can be configured to run any of the simulation camera angles in the repo.
